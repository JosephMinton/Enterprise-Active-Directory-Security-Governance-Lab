# Enterprise Active Directory Security Governance Lab
<h1>Centralized Network Sharing and FSRM Implementation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab is Part IV of a multipart Active Directory home lab series. This phase focuses on the implementation of centralized file services, the critical distinction between Share and NTFS permissions, and the automation of network resource access via Group Policy Preferences. Additionally, the lab introduces storage governance through File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) to enforce storage limits and restrict unauthorized file types
<br />

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Successfully provision and manage network resources to ensure data availability and storage security within the Enterprise environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provision Shared Resources: Create a centralized "shared" folder and configure tiered access controls</li>
<li><strong>Establish Permission Hierarchies: Implement and differentiate between Share permissions (folder level) and NTFS security settings (file/subfolder level)</li>
<li><strong>Automate Resource Access: Utilize Group Policy Preferences to deploy persistent mapped drives to domain users, replacing inefficient manual mapping</li>
<li><strong>Implement Storage Governance: Deploy FSRM to manage storage limits via quotas and restrict unauthorized file types through screening</li>
</ul>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

<h1>I. Network Share Provisioning & Permission Hierarchies</h1><br/>
 <p>Establishing a centralized repository for company data to make editing and sharing of files easier for all users in the environment. This process requires a two layered security approach: Share permissions for network level access and NTFS permissions for granular file level control.</p>

<p>To facilitate resource sharing, I created a directory on the server's local storage and configured access for the "Domain Users" group.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directory Creation: Created a folder named "shared" in the Local Disk (C:) path.</li>
<br><br>

<br />
  <br><br>
<li><strong>Share Level Configuration: Navigated to Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing and enabled "Share this folder".</li>
<li><strong>Access Control: Added "Domain Users" to the permissions list and set them to Read access.</li>
  <li><strong> - Discovery: Share permissions apply only at the folder level and do not affect individual subfolders or files.</li> <br><br>

<br />
   <br><br>
<li><strong>NTFS Security Integration: Switched to the Security tab to configure detailed NTFS permissions, which apply to all subfolders and files within the directory.</li> <br><br>

<br />
</ul>
 
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>It is vital to distinguish between these two permission types: Shared permissions apply only at the folder level, meaning they do not affect subfolders or files individually. Conversely, NTFS permissions are applied to the folder and everything under it, including all subfolders and files, offering the granular control required for enterprise security</p>

<h1>II. Manual Mapping vs. Automated GPO Drive Mapping</h1>

<p>Verifying client-side connectivity by mapping the network resource to a local drive letter. While manual mapping is useful for temporary access, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are used for permanent, automated enterprise wide deployment.</p>
<h2>Action Taken</h2>
<p>I transitioned from a session-based manual map to a persistent GPO-driven network share to ensure all users maintain access after reboots.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hostname Identification: Utilized the hostname command in the Server's CMD to identify the server name required for the UNC path.</strong></li> <br><br>

<br /> <br><br>
<li><strong>Client Verification: On the Windows client, I mapped the S: drive to \\ServerName\shared to confirm the folder was accessible over the network.</strong></li> <br><br>

<br />

<br /> <br><br>
<li><strong>GPO Automation: Because manual maps are not persistent after a reboot, I created a GPO named "map drives".</strong></li>
<li><strong>Configuration: Under User Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings > Drive Maps, I defined a new mapped drive with the server path and assigned it to drive letter S

<br />

<br /> <br><br>
<li><strong>Final Deployment: Linked the GPO to the Users OU and ran gpupdate /force on the client to automate the mapping process.</strong></li>

<br />
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Manual drive mapping is useful for temporary admin tasks, but it is not a persistent solution for general users. If the client machine reboots, a manually mapped drive will disappear, creating a significant administrative burden if users have to remap it every time they log in</p>


<h1>III. Storage Governance via File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)</h1>

<p>Implementing administrative controls to manage and classify data stored on file servers. This prevents storage depletion by setting limits and restricting the upload of non-business related files.</p>
<h2>Action Path</h2>
<p>I installed the FSRM tool and implemented quotas and file screening on the "shared" folder to manage finite server hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tool Installation: Utilized Add Roles and Features in Server Manager to install File Server Resource Manager under File and Storage Services.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Quota Management: Created a custom quota for the "shared" folder with a 10GB limit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Threshold Configuration: Set an 80% notification threshold to alert administrators before the storage limit is reached.</strong></li>

<br />
<br><br>
<li><strong>File Screening: Implemented a screen to block Audio and Video files, Executable files, and Image files.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Final Configuration: Restricted the folder to text and document file types to prevent multimedia files from consuming excessive storage space.</strong></li> <br><br>

<br><br>

</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Automating drive mapping via GPO Preferences ensures a consistent user experience while reducing manual administrative tasks. Simultaneously, FSRM provides a critical layer of storage governance, ensuring that the file server remains operational and is not filled with unauthorized or heavy multimedia data</p>

<br><br>

<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permissions are Multi-Layered: Share permissions provide basic entry at the folder level, but NTFS permissions are required for granular, persistent control over individual subfolders and files</li>
<li><strong>Automation Equals Persistence: Manual drive mapping is session-based and disappears after a reboot; Group Policy Preferences must be used to ensure network shares are automatically and reliably mapped for every user login</li>
<li><strong>Governance Prevents Exhaustion: Server storage is finite and expensive; utilizing FSRM to implement quotas and file screening is essential to prevent storage depletion from unauthorized or oversized multimedia files</li>
</ul>
